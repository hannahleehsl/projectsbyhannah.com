                They appeared in regular live broadcasts of a series called
                <i>Seventeen TV</i> where they would show their practice
                performances to the general public. Their company, Pledis
                Entertainment, didn't have a lot of money so they were preparing
                for their debut in less-than ideal conditions. They also
                appeared on the reality show
                <i>Seventeen Project: Big Debut Plan</i> which ended with their
                long-awaited debut.

                Their first studio album, <i>Love & Letter</i>, was released on
                April 25 which helped launch their international popularity. Not
                only were they successful on domestic charts, but in Japan as
                well. Their album's lead single "Pretty U" won them their first
                major win on a music show, and promotions started for their
                first tour. They also released their third EP,
                <i>Going Seventeen</i>.

                studio album, <i>An Ode</i>. Following its release, the group
                won their first Daesang (the most prestigious Korean music

                On April 1, Seventeen released their second Japanese single,
                "Fallin' Flower", placing first on <i>Billboard's</i> Japan Hot
                100 Chart. Their seventh EP, <i>Heng:ar√¶</i>, sold one million
                copies in under a week making the group official "million
                sellers". On July 7, the album also charted at number one on the
                Oricon Weekly Album Chart for a second week, making Seventeen
                the first international male artist to do so since the
                Backstreet Boys over 12 years ago. Because of their immense
                popularity, HYBE Labels (BTS's Label) bought Pledis
                Entertainment for Seventeen.
